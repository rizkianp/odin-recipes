    <h1>Rendang</h1>

        Before we start, let me give you a quick context into this rich and flavor-packed dish. Rendang is a classic dish of Southeast Asian cuisine. While there are countless variations to this dish, Rendang is originally an  Indonesian spicy meat stew that came from the Minangkabau region in West Sumatra.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another interesting point is Rendang can be made with any cuts of meat, or even vegan substitutes! That said, rendang is most commonly made with beef, slow cooked and braised in a fragrant blend of coconut milk and rich spice mixture. The result? An incredibly flavorful and tender beef stew, perfectly caramelized and infused with fragrant spices.
    </p>
    <p>
        Original recipes for rendang call for the mixture to be simmered for 5-6 hours. While this is still the preferred method of cooking in many Indonesian restaurants, I’ll be showing you a shorter version (1 hour and 40 minutes!) that don’t sacrifice on the rich flavor and tender texture.
