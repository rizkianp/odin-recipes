        Rawon is a popular Indonesian beef soup that originated from Surabaya, East Java. Traditionally, rawon is characterized by its black color, which comes from one of its main ingredients: black keluak nut. In this recipe, the use of keluak is what brings out Rawon’s dark color and nutty flavor!

        Nowadays, you can find several variations of Nasi Rawon all over Indonesia. For example, Balinese Rawon omits the use of keluak, which makes its soup a brown color rather than black. But the most popular version is still the traditional East Java version (which is the version we’ll make in this recipe).
